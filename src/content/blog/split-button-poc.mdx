> Teams repeatedly recreate “primary action + caret menu” patterns. This POC tested whether EUI should offer a standard split button to reduce inconsistency and custom CSS.

## Challenge
Product surfaces often need a single *primary* action plus a small set of related actions (e.g., *Run*, with options like *Run with params*, *Schedule*, *Share*).  
Teams hand-roll this pattern with different components (buttons + popovers), which creates inconsistency and extra QA surface.

## Idea
Prototype a split button that:
- Exposes a clear **primary** action (left side)  
- Provides a compact **menu trigger** (right side) for related actions  
- Plays nicely with existing EUI theming, sizes, and iconography  
- Keeps focus/keyboard behavior predictable and accessible

## AI Workflow
- **ChatGPT** helped outline the component API (props, event surface, disabled/loading states) and accessibility considerations (focus ring, aria-expanded, menu roles).
- **Cursor** scaffolded the TSX component and story, wired up keyboard handling, and iterated prop types.
- I tested usage on real product flows to check sizing, density, and common action clusters.

## Outcome
- A working split button POC with primary click + caret-triggered menu  
- Early API shape for discussion (e.g., `items`, `onPrimaryClick`, `isLoading`, `size`, `color`)  
- Identified a11y and theming edge cases to solve before formalizing

## Reflection
This clarified demand for a shared pattern and helped frame the API discussion around real usage, not hypotheticals. AI tools sped up scaffolding so we could spend more time on behavior and accessibility.
