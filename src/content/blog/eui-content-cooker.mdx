> Good design starts with believable content.  
> **EUI Content Cooker** helps Elastic designers prototype with realism — generating authentic data, converting structures, and editing tables directly in Figma.

## Challenge
Designers across Elastic often mocked up screens using placeholder text or generic data.  
The results looked synthetic, especially when testing scale or presenting high-fidelity flows to stakeholders.  

We also lacked efficient ways to update key Elastic UI patterns — like breadcrumbs and data tables — which required manual setup and formatting.

## Idea
Build a **Figma plugin** that streamlines realistic content and layout creation for Elastic designs.  
The tool began as a data generator, but evolved into a full **content and structure utility** that supports three key workflows:

1. **Data Generation:** Populate mockups with Elastic-specific fields — `service.name`, `host.name`, `@timestamp`, trace IDs, and more — using AI-defined data patterns.  
2. **Breadcrumb Builder:** Convert a simple list of strings into correctly formatted EUI breadcrumb items, ready to drop into any page design.  
3. **Table Editing:** Enable designers to adjust and test data layouts with direct table editing — set column widths, move or duplicate columns, and align text to mimic EUI behavior.

## AI Workflow
- **ChatGPT** helped define generator logic for data fields and create formatting rules for breadcrumb and table structures.  
- **Cursor** scaffolded the plugin’s architecture (manifest, worker, and UI panel) and wired up TypeScript utilities for Figma integration.  
- Iterated on real Elastic designs to fine-tune realism, spacing, and layout fidelity.  
- Each feature (data, breadcrumbs, tables) became modular, allowing future extensions or integration into an internal EUI design toolkit.

## Outcome
- A multi-purpose Figma plugin that speeds up Elastic design work:  
  - Realistic Elastic-specific data population  
  - One-click breadcrumb conversion  
  - Editable tables with width, alignment, and duplication controls  
- Improved realism and flexibility in Observability and Security mockups  
- Designers can now test scale, structure, and hierarchy without switching tools or hand-crafting layouts  
- Consistent visual alignment with EUI components and real product behavior

## Reflection
**EUI Content Cooker** turned routine Figma busywork into a creative advantage.  
By combining AI-generated content with structured layout tools, it helps designers focus on interaction and flow — not formatting.  

This project represents what I love most: using AI to **extend design systems into practical, empowering tools** that make design faster, more expressive, and more connected to the real product.
