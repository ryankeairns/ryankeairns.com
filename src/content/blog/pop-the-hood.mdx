## Challenge
Teams often re-implement components or miss existing patterns because discovery in a live product UI is hard. Inspecting the DOM works, but it’s slow, noisy, and disconnected from documentation.  

I wanted a lightweight overlay that not only identified EUI components, but also connected each one directly to its source documentation.

## Idea
Build a **Chrome extension** that scans the DOM for EUI component signatures and displays tooltip labels — e.g., `EuiBadge`, `EuiEmptyPrompt`, `EuiTable`. Each label reveals a small popover that links directly to the relevant docs or pattern on the EUI site, turning a static inspection tool into a **navigable design-system map**.  

To achieve this, I used AI tools to generate a mapping between **EUI component names and their documentation URLs**. That map powers the extension’s popover, ensuring every identified component includes a contextual **“View Docs”** link — keeping designers and engineers in flow.

## AI Workflow
- **ChatGPT** helped plan the extension architecture (manifest v3, permissions, content vs. background scripts) and the DOM scanning logic.  
- **Cursor** scaffolded the content script, event listeners, and tooltip injection while debugging hover/focus collisions and throttling issues.  
- I used **ChatGPT** again to parse and map EUI’s component index to its documentation routes, generating a lookup object automatically.  
- The result: an always-up-to-date component-to-docs map, auto-refreshed as EUI evolves.

## Outcome
- Chrome extension overlay that labels EUI components directly on live Kibana pages  
- Popover tooltips display component names and a **direct link to EUI documentation**  
- AI-generated mapping keeps doc links accurate without manual maintenance  
- Low-overhead toggle via toolbar; performant enough for daily use  
- Adopted informally by designers and engineers exploring new UI patterns

## Reflection
**Pop the Hood** removes guesswork and bridges the gap between the product UI and the design system. By combining DOM inspection with AI-generated documentation mapping, I turned a quick debugging utility into a living reference tool.  

It’s a small, fast, and surprisingly useful way to make design systems more discoverable — right where people work.
