## Challenge

Users analyzing logs in Kibana's Discover often miss important patterns because:
- They're focused on individual events (line-by-line reading)
- Anomalies and spikes are buried in the timeline
- No visual cues for high-impact fields
- Switching to dashboards/visualizations breaks flow

**Key Pain Point:** "I wish Discover would just **tell me** what's interesting in my data."

## Idea

What if Discover could **surface observability insights automatically**—without users having to build queries or dashboards?

**Vision:**
- **Anomaly indicators** directly in the timeline (spikes, drops, patterns)
- **Field value highlights** showing unusual or high-cardinality values
- **Smart suggestions** based on data patterns
- **Inline visualizations** for key fields
- **Contextual explanations** ("Error rate spiked 3x in last 15min")

Build a **functional POC** to demonstrate the vision and test technical feasibility.

## AI Workflow

### Concept Development (ChatGPT)
- Explored anomaly detection algorithms (statistical vs ML-based)
- Discussed real-time processing constraints
- Analyzed existing patterns in APM, Logs, and Metrics UIs
- Generated initial component architecture

### Implementation (Cursor + Manual)
- Built timeline overlay for anomaly visualization
- Implemented simple statistical anomaly detection (z-score)
- Created field value ranking system (cardinality + change rate)
- Added inline mini-charts for numeric fields
- Styled contextual insight cards
- Mocked ML-based suggestions (future capability)

### Validation
- Tested with real Elasticsearch data (logs, APM traces)
- Demonstrated to product team and UX researchers
- Gathered feedback on usefulness vs. noise
- Identified performance constraints for real-time analysis

## Outcome

**Working POC** demonstrating:

✨ **Smart Timeline:**
- Visual markers for anomalies (error spikes, traffic drops)
- Hover tooltips with context ("5x error rate increase")
- Clickable regions to focus on anomalous time ranges

✨ **Field Insights:**
- Highlighted fields with unusual values
- Badge indicators for high cardinality or rapid change
- Inline sparklines for numeric fields

✨ **Contextual Suggestions:**
- "Most common error messages in this time range"
- "New error types appeared 5 minutes ago"
- "Unusual spike in API latency detected"

**Key Learnings:**
- Performance: Real-time anomaly detection requires careful optimization
- UX Balance: Too many insights = noise; need smart filtering
- Trust: Users want to understand **why** something is flagged as interesting
- Integration: Works best when connected to ML jobs and alerting

## Reflection

### POCs as Vision Communication

This POC wasn't about shipping code—it was about **demonstrating possibility**. By building a functional prototype, I could:
- Show stakeholders the **feeling** of the experience
- Validate technical feasibility with engineering
- Identify UX challenges that mockups would miss
- Generate excitement and buy-in for future investment

### AI-Assisted Prototyping

**ChatGPT** helped me:
- Rapidly explore anomaly detection approaches without deep ML expertise
- Understand statistical methods (z-score, IQR, moving averages)
- Identify existing Elasticsearch capabilities to leverage

**Cursor** helped me:
- Implement statistical calculations quickly
- Generate data transformation logic
- Build visualization components
- Debug performance issues

### Balancing Vision and Reality

The POC deliberately included **aspirational features** (ML-powered suggestions) alongside **achievable features** (statistical anomalies). This helped product leadership see both:
1. What we could ship **soon** (quick wins)
2. Where we could go **long-term** (strategic vision)

## Supplemental

### Technical Approach

**Anomaly Detection:**
- Z-score analysis on time-series aggregations
- Sliding window for baseline comparison (30min windows)
- Threshold tuning based on data density
- Placeholder integration with Elasticsearch ML jobs

**Performance Considerations:**
- Aggregations run on sampled data for speed
- Caching for repeated queries
- Progressive enhancement (load insights after initial results)
- WebWorkers for client-side calculations

### Design Principles

1. **Non-intrusive:** Insights are additive, don't block core workflow
2. **Explainable:** Every insight includes context and reasoning
3. **Actionable:** Clicking an insight filters/focuses the data
4. **Trustworthy:** Visual confidence indicators (low/medium/high certainty)

### User Feedback (Internal Testing)

> "This would have saved me 20 minutes this morning. I was manually hunting for error spikes." — SRE user

> "Love the field highlights. I never think to check cardinality changes." — Support engineer

> "Needs tuning—too many 'insights' on high-volume data—but the concept is solid." — Product manager

### Future Enhancements (Identified Through POC)

- **ML Integration:** Connect to Elasticsearch anomaly detection jobs
- **Customization:** Let users tune sensitivity and which insights to show
- **Collaboration:** Share insights with team (link to specific anomaly)
- **Historical Context:** Compare current anomalies to past patterns
- **Root Cause Suggestions:** "This spike correlates with deployment X"

### Lessons Learned

1. **Build to learn:** This POC revealed performance constraints early
2. **Vision POCs need polish:** Even non-production code needs good UX to communicate vision
3. **Stakeholder demos matter:** Live demo generated more excitement than slide decks ever could
4. **Document learnings:** POC value extends beyond the code—capture insights for future teams
