> This project showed what happens when AI closes that gap.

## Challenge
For years, designers across the Platform and solution teams had shared concepts for making Kibana's home pages — Discover, Dashboard, and the main entry point — more dynamic and relevant.  
The vision was to surface user-specific content such as "recent dashboards," "saved searches," or contextual entry points based on the data they worked with most.  

Everyone agreed it was a good idea. It just never made it to the top of the roadmap.  
Without engineering time to prototype it, the concept sat untouched in Figma files and old Slack threads.

## Idea
Revisit the original ideas and rebuild them as working, in-product proofs of concept using AI-assisted coding.  
My goal was to show that *personalized home pages* weren't just design aspirations — they could be real, functional, and achievable within the existing Kibana architecture.  

I used ChatGPT to help sketch the architecture and Cursor to scaffold live prototypes in a local Kibana instance.  
Within a few short demos, I had fully functional examples showing dynamic content based on user context — all running in code, not mockups.

## AI Workflow
- **ChatGPT** helped identify where and how the home page components were rendered, how content modules were fetched, and where new data hooks could integrate safely.  
- **Cursor** handled scaffolding the POC components, wiring up conditional content, and debugging rendering and routing issues.  
- I iterated directly inside a **live Kibana instance**, creating multiple prototype versions to demonstrate different personalization strategies.  
- AI tools made it possible to move from *idea to working demo* in days — something that had sat dormant for *years*.  
- Presented the prototypes to the **entire Platform team**, sparking discussion around new content management capabilities and where they should live.

## Outcome
- Functional POCs for dynamic home pages in **Discover**, **Dashboard**, and **Kibana Home**  
- Showed real-time examples of personalized, user-aware layouts in code  
- Demonstrated the feasibility (and current limits) of Kibana's content management approach  
- Catalyzed cross-team alignment on next steps for user-specific content architecture  
- Revealed a hidden architectural issue: the **TableListView component** used on several pages was an entire page implementation, not a reusable component — blocking adoption elsewhere  
- As a result, new planned work is now underway to **refactor TableListView** into modular, reusable pieces  

## Reflection
This project captured what I love about designing in product.  
AI tools made it possible to un-shelve multi-year design ideas and prove them in real, working code.  
Seeing the team's reaction — and watching those prototypes evolve into planned engineering work — was deeply rewarding.  
Sometimes, all an idea needs is someone willing to bring it back to life with the right tools.
