## 1. Problem Framing

Kibana’s **Spaces** feature allowed admins to separate environments for different data sets or teams — but it didn’t map cleanly to how customers actually understood the product.  
Users thought in terms of *solutions* (Security, Observability, Cloud) rather than abstract containers called “spaces.”  
This disconnect led to confusion, fragmented ownership, and inconsistent onboarding across Elastic’s largest solutions.

The **business opportunity** was to adapt the existing Spaces architecture so that customers could navigate Kibana through a clear, solution-based lens — bringing the classic deployment experience closer to the serverless “project-based” model Elastic was promoting for new users.

I led the design direction for this effort, partnering with PMs and engineers across all major solution teams. The stakes were high: if we didn’t solve this, users would continue to experience friction switching between solutions, and Elastic would struggle to deliver a cohesive cross-product story.

## 2. Design Process & Decision-Making

We began by auditing how Spaces were being used across different solutions.  
Through telemetry, internal interviews, and FullStory sessions, we discovered that the confusion wasn’t about *how Spaces worked* — it was about *what they represented*.  
Most users didn’t realize that Spaces were intended to house solution contexts, not just collections of dashboards.

### Alternatives Considered
- **Option 1:** Introduce a new “Projects” layer, mimicking the serverless model.  
- **Option 2:** Visually repurpose Spaces as solution views while preserving their existing behavior.  
- **Option 3:** Merge Spaces and Solutions into a unified concept.

We chose **Option 2** because it achieved immediate clarity for users without breaking existing admin configurations.  
It also aligned with leadership’s goal to modernize the classic experience incrementally.

### Key Constraints
- We couldn’t disrupt existing deployments or lose compatibility with older APIs.  
- Admins needed full backward compatibility for roles and permissions.  
- Engineering capacity was limited — any solution had to be lightweight and phased.

### Iteration
We started with low-fidelity wireframes shared in tight loops with stakeholders, expanding outward as alignment grew.  
Early prototypes showed that surfacing solution context at the top of the Spaces UI dramatically improved orientation, so we leaned into that concept.  
Once validated, I built higher-fidelity mockups in Figma and worked with an engineer to deliver a coded prototype for user review.

## 3. Collaboration & Delivery

This project required close coordination between the Platform, Security, and Observability teams.  
I led weekly design syncs to align on terminology, data flows, and visual hierarchy.  
To avoid design-by-committee, I created a **reference prototype** that served as the single source of truth across teams — ensuring consistent implementation and messaging.

We partnered with engineering to integrate the feature behind a flag, rolling it out first to internal users and then to new trials.  
This allowed us to validate adoption safely before affecting existing customers.  
I documented patterns, authored a migration guide, and facilitated async feedback loops across time zones to keep velocity high.

One key **trade-off**: we postponed adding user-level customization (user-defined default solution views) to keep the MVP focused and technically feasible.  
That insight later evolved into a new initiative — *User-Based Solution View Switching* — which became its own exploratory project.

## 4. Impact

The rollout achieved its primary goal: **clarity without disruption**.  
We successfully reintroduced solution-oriented navigation into the classic deployment experience without creating confusion or breaking admin workflows.

Adoption was steady among new users and trial deployments.  
Existing customers appreciated that their configurations continued to work unchanged, while new onboarding flows saw higher first-session success rates (based on FullStory task completion metrics).

Beyond quantitative results, the project brought multiple solution teams into a shared design and engineering cadence — a significant cultural win that improved collaboration across Kibana.

If I were to improve this next time, I’d integrate product analytics earlier to capture long-term engagement trends beyond initial adoption.

## 5. Visual Craft & Systems Thinking

Visually, I focused on **clarity and continuity** — aligning the Spaces layout and color system with the upcoming Chrome redesign while introducing subtle cues for solution context.  
Typography, spacing, and motion timing were refined for better rhythm across views.  
Accessibility remained a core priority: we standardized color contrast and keyboard navigation patterns inherited from EUI.

This work also established a foundation for future personalization features and reinforced Kibana’s broader design system consistency.

## 6. Communication & Storytelling

This project told a clear story: *how aligning product architecture with user mental models can simplify complexity at scale.*  
By reframing Spaces through the lens of solution ownership, we helped both customers and internal teams speak the same language.  
It became a model for how the Platform UX team can bridge business direction, user experience, and technical constraints in a single design narrative.
