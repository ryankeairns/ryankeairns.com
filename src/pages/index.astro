        <p>I’m a Principal-level product designer with 20+ years of experience across UX, UI, and technical implementation. What drives me is execution: moving from idea to production quickly and reliably.</p>
        <p>My background bridges design and engineering, allowing me to operate strategically while also delivering production-ready solutions. I focus on designing, prototyping, and shipping — not slowing progress with unnecessary process.</p>
        <p>Always open to conversations about design, product challenges, and building teams and systems that scale.</p>
