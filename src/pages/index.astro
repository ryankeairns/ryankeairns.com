        <p>I’m a UX designer with two decades of experience making complex products usable. My strength is working directly in code—HTML, CSS, React—because working software proves ideas faster than polished mockups or endless decks.</p>
        <p>I focus on design systems and scalable interfaces, helping teams simplify complexity and ship improvements that stick. My approach is iterative, collaborative, and hands-on: no fluff, no over-promising, just practical solutions delivered where they matter most.</p>
