        <p>I am a product-minded designer who contributes code.</p>
        <p>For the most part, I have worked on large-scale web applications and design systems, collaborating with engineers, product managers, and designers to shape and ship <em><s>product experiences</s></em> user interfaces for software.</p>
        <p>Recently, I have explored how AI coding tools such as Windsurf and Cursor are changing the ways we - as code-capable designers - design and build.</p>
        <p>My goal is to help designers and design team leaders remain sharp, adaptable, and confident as the industry evolves. If you seek to stay hands-on, expand your impact, or navigate the future, you will find that focus in the work I share.</p>
